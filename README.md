# B Wing vs TIE Fighter
![Gameplay](/gameplay.01.gif)

This is just a test project for me to learn Godot 3.1, as such it's using free art assets and/or assets I've made.

## Project Goal

I love Sci-fi space combat and space simulation games. I envision this as a mix of Freespace, Battlefront space portions, and the old X Wing vs. TIE Fighter series.

## Using the app.

This app was made with [Godot 3.1](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.1.1/Godot_v3.1.1-stable_win64.exe.zip) ([Download page](https://godotengine.org/download))
